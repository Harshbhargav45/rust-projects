# Rust Book Projects 🦀

This repository contains the three major projects built while following [**The Rust Programming Language**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (the "Book"). These projects demonstrate core Rust concepts including ownership, error handling, I/O, and concurrency.

## Projects

1.  [**Guessing Game**](#1-guessing-game-chapter-2) - A CLI game to practice basic syntax and inputs.
2.  [**Minigrep**](#2-minigrep-chapter-12) - A command-line tool to search for strings in files (grep clone).
3.  [**Multithreaded Web Server**](#3-multithreaded-web-server-chapter-20) - An HTTP server handling requests asynchronously using a thread pool.
